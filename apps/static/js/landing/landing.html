            <h2>Who built this site?</h2>
            <p>
                Well I'm glad you asked! My name is Daniel Gopar, I'm basically a self-taught programmer and this site
                is a way to see what I could do with Django and AngularJS. I got to say that I seriously love Python,
                Django, and AngularJS was really awesome to learn. I added Bootstrap for some default styling, cause
                you know "Something is better than nothing". </p>

            <p> Anyways, You can read my
                <a href="http://pygopar.com/">blog</a>, look at video tutorials I've made on
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCRdRbI93UGW0AZttVH3SbA">YouTube</a> or checkout my
                <a href="https://github.com/gopar/">GitHub</a> account. Or if you want to get in touch, just send me and email.
            </p>

            <h2> How is this site built?</h2>
            <p> This site is built using <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, an awesome Python web framework,
                <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>, A Front End Javascript framework,
                and <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Twitter Bootstrap</a>, an easy way to make sites friendly and pretty.
                For building the API I used <a href="http://django-rest-framework.org">Django Rest Framework (DRF)</a>,
                which makes it easy to implement and API over an existing database and models. </p>
            <p>There is even an android client thanks to the API! Go check it out \o/</p>

            <p><b>Absolutely!</b></p>
            <p>Everything that was made into creating this website can be found in my GitHub repository.
                Just install all the requirements and you're good to go. Also feel free to fix/report bugs
